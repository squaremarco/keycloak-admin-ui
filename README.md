# Keycloak Admin Console V2
This project is the next generation of the Keycloak Administration Console.  It is written with React and [PatternFly 4][1].

## Development Instructions

For development on this project you will need a running Keycloak server listening on port 8180.

1. Start keycloak
    * Download and run with one command
        ```bash
        $> ./start.mjs
        ```
    * or download Keycloak server from [keycloak downloads page][2] unpack and run it like:
        ```bash
        $> cd <unpacked download folder>/bin
        $> standalone -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
        ```
1. Go to the clients section of the existing Keycloak Admin Console and add the client
    * like this:
    ![realm settings](./realm-settings.png "Realm Settings")
    * or click on the "Select file" button and import `security-admin-console-v2.json`
    * or run `$> ./import.mjs`

1. Install dependencies and run:
    ```bash
    $> npm install
    $> npm run start
    ```

## Build and run through Docker
    git checkout git@github.com:keycloak/keycloak-admin-ui.git
    cd keycloak-admin-ui
    docker build -t keycloak-v2 .
    docker run --name keycloak-v2 -d -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin keycloak-v2 -Dprofile.feature.newadmin=enabled

You can reach the new admin interface at `http://localhost:8080`. Then go to `Realm Settings --> Themes` and set Admin Console Theme to `cmco`.

If your Keycloak instance is not on `localhost:8180`, create a file `.env` with the following:

    KEYCLOAK_ENDPOINT=https:\/\/remoteinstance.keycloak.com

## Building as a Keycloak theme

If you want to build the application using Maven and produce a JAR that can be installed directly into Keycloak, check out the [Keycloak theme documentation](./keycloak-theme/README.md).

## Linting

Every time you create a commit it should be automatically linted and formatted for you. It is also possible to trigger the linting manually:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Theming

It's possible to theme the Admin UI interface, this is useful if you want to apply your own branding so that the product looks familiar to your users. The Admin UI comes with two built-in themes called `keycloak` and `rh-sso`, by default the `keycloak` theme will be used when building the application.

This behavior can be changed by passing in a `THEME_NAME` environment variable, for example if wanted to build the application using the `rh-sso` theme we can do the following:

```bash
THEME_NAME=rh-sso npm run build
```

And likewise if we wanted to start a development server with this theme:

```
THEME_NAME=rh-sso npm run start
```

To make it simpler to build the `rh-sso` theme there are some shorthand NPM scripts available that you can run instead:

```bash
# Run a production build with the 'rh-sso' theme
npm run build:rh-sso

# Or for development
npm run start:rh-sso 
```

### Creating your own theme

All themes are located in the `themes/` directory of the project, if you want to create a new theme you can create a new directory here and name it the same as your theme. Copy the files from the default theme here and customize them to your liking.

## Keycloak UI Test Suite in Cypress

This repository contains the UI tests for Keycloak developed with Cypress framework
### Prerequisites
* `Keycloak distribution` has to be [downloaded](https://www.keycloak.org/downloads) and started on 8081 port.  
**note**: the port in at the test suite side in [cypress.json](cypress.json) or at the Keycloak side, see [Keycloak Getting Started Guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/getting_started/#starting-the-keycloak-server),
* `npm package manager` has to be [downloaded](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and installed.

### via Cypress Test Runner

**By using `npx`:**

**note**: [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) is included with `npm > v5.2` or can be installed separately.

```shell
npx cypress open
```

After a moment, the Cypress Test Runner will launch:

### via terminal

**By executing:**

```shell
$(npm bin)/cypress run
```

...or...

```shell
./node_modules/.bin/cypress run
```

...or... (requires npm@5.2.0 or greater)

```shell
npx cypress run
```
**To execute a specific test on a specific browser run:**

```shell
cypress run --spec "cypress/integration/example-test.spec.js" --browser chrome
```
**note**: the complete list of parameters can be found in the [official Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#Commands).

/assets (added to .gitignore)
  /videos - if test fails, the video is stored here
  /screenshots - if test fails, the screenshot is stored here
/cypress
  /fixtures - external pieces of static data that can be used by your tests
  /integration - used for test files (supported filetypes are .js, .jsx, .coffee and .cjsx)
  /plugins
    - index.js - extends Cypress behaviour, custom plugins are imported before every single spec file run
  /support - reusable behaviour
    - commands.js - custom commands
    - index.js - runs before each test file

/cypress.json - Cypress configuration file
/jsconfig.json - Cypress code autocompletion is enabled here
